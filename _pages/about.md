Our interest focuses on the intersection between Technology and Biology, in particular, artificial intelligence (AI) and protein design. Proteins are nanoscopic, biodegradable materials capable of performing a wide variety of functions, from capturing and fixing C02 to degrading PET plastic bottles, passing by binding antigens. Their design in a controlled fashion opens the door to tackle many open challenges, such as the climate crisis or curing terminal diseases.

Despite their attractive properties and unmatched potential, designing proteins with tailored properties is still quite challenging, often reaching several years. We believe, however, that AI can enormously accelerate the protein design process. In this group, our primary goal is to build models that give us complete control over the design process, i.e., generate proteins given a set of human instructions like ‘catalyze NH3 formation.’

We are also interested in protein evolution in drug discovery; anything related to proteins is welcome! If you’d like to know more, look at our [projects’ page]()
